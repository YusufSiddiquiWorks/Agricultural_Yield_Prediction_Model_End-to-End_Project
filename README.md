# Agriculture Yield Prediction Regression Model

## Project Overview
This solo project showcases my expertise in data science and machine learning by developing a robust regression model for agricultural yield prediction. The project covers the entire workflow, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and hyperparameter tuning, culminating in deployment on Azure.

## Features
- **Yield Prediction**: Predicts agricultural yield using a range of input features.
- **Comprehensive Workflow**: Includes EDA, data preprocessing, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning.
- **Azure Deployment**: The model is deployed on Azure for easy access and scalability.
- **Automated CI/CD**: Continuous integration and deployment using GitHub Actions ensure a smooth and reliable workflow.

## Live Application
Access the live application here: [Agriculture Yield Prediction App](https://agricultural-yield-predicition-project-d0excudddneufzam.uaenorth-01.azurewebsites.net/)

## Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset featuring:
- **Properties**: Soil Type, Region, Crop Type.
- **Weather Conditions**: Temperature, rainfall, and more.
- **Crop Management Practices**: Fertilizer use, irrigation, etc.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core language for the project.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn**: Used for model development and hyperparameter tuning.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization for EDA.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive development and analysis.
- **Azure**: Cloud platform for deployment.
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline implementation.

3. Receive yield predictions instantly.

## Results
The model has been rigorously evaluated, with performance metrics including:
- Root Mean Squared Error: 0.5041
- Mean Absolute Error: 0.4024
- R2 Score: 0.9117

## Methodology
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Performed in-depth analysis to understand data distributions and relationships.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared data for model training.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created new features to enhance model performance.
